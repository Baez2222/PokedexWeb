# PokedexWeb

To populate database:

- copy pokedex.sql file into your server and run the necessary tables

- update config.ini to match your server configurations

- go to the very bottom of pokedexDB.py. Uncomment the functions being called in *if __name__ == '__main__':*

- run pokedexDB.py and hopefully it will populate the database
